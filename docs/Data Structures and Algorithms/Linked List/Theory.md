A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers (in C or C++) or references (in Java, Python and JavaScript). Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list, as the nodes are not stored contiguously in memory.


# **Linked Lists vs Arrays**
## Linked List
- **Data Structure:** Non-contiguous
- **Memory Allocation:** Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
- **Insertion/Deletion:** Efficient
- **Access:** Sequential
## Array
- **Data Structure:** Contiguous
- **Memory Allocation:** Typically allocated to the whole array
- **Insertion/Deletion:** Inefficient
- **Access:** Random
