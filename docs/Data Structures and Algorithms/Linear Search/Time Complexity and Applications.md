# **Time Complexity**

<br />

**Best Case:** In the best case, the key might be present at the first index. So the best case complexity is O(1)

**Worst Case:** In the worst case, the key might be present at the last index i.e., opposite to the end from which the search has started in the list. So the worst-case complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the list.

**Average Case**: O(N)

**Auxiliary Space:** O(1) as except for the variable to iterate through the list, no other variable is used.

# **Applications of Linear Search Algorithm**
<br />

- **Unsorted Lists:** When we have an unsorted array or list, linear search is most commonly used to find any element in the collection.
Small Data Sets: Linear Search is preferred over binary search when we have small data sets with

- **Searching Linked Lists:** In linked list implementations, linear search is commonly used to find elements within the list. Each node is checked sequentially until the desired element is found.
Simple Implementation: Linear Search is much easier to understand and implement as compared to Binary Search or Ternary Search.
